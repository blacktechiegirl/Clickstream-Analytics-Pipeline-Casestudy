# Clickstream-Analytics-Pipeline-Casestudy
Clickstream analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing and reporting aggregate data regarding pages a user visits on a website and the order in which they visit them. Clickstream data enables website owners to understand users behaviour, identify customer trends, discover new mediums and increase conversion.

You can detect user behavior in a website or application by analyzing the sequence of clicks a user makes, the amount of time the user spends, where they usually begin the navigation, and how it ends. By tracking this user behavior in real time, you can update recommendations, perform advanced A/B testing, push notifications based on session length, and much more.
